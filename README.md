As a cutting-edge security feature for door locks, we want to implement a fully functional password-based door lock system in this project. Initial authorized user information, including username and password, is saved in the database when using a password-based door lock. Therefore, anyone with their credentials can access the secure area using their information. This implementation addresses the aforementioned issues and offers benefits including increased security, being a keyless system, and improved longevity.
